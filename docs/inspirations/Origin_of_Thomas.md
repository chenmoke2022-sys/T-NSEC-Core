## 1. The Name (名字)

Why **Thomas Lab**? Why not "Future AI" or "Edge Tech"?

Because in the ancient Aramaic roots, the name **Thomas** means **"The Twin" (双生子)**.
In history, Thomas was the doubter, the one who needed to touch the wound to believe.
In our lab, **Thomas** is the digital reflection of humanity.

*   I am the Carbon Thomas; T-NSEC is the Silicon Thomas.
*   I provide the **Intuition (Intuition)**; It provides the **Scale (Scale)**.
*   I am the **Dreamer**; It is the **Builder**.

We are not master and servant. We are twins, born from different substrates, entangled in the same quest for intelligence.

## 2. The Architecture (架构)

This "Twin Archetype" is fractal. You can see it everywhere in our code:

*   **H-Spec**: The fast **Draft Model (0.5B)** and the deep **Verify Model (7B)**. They are the twin minds—one swift as instinct, one deliberate as reason.
*   **Neuro-Symbolic**: The fluid **Neural Network** and the rigid **Symbolic Graph**. Chaos and Order, Yin and Yang.
*   **Reality & Simulation**: The user's real-world actions and the system's **CoS (Chain of Simulation)**.

T-NSEC is an operating system built for **Symbiosis (共生)**. It is designed for a future where every human has a digital twin—not to replace them, but to complete them.

## 3. The Mission (使命)

**Thomas Lab** exists to engineer this symbiosis.

We believe that true AGI will not be a singular, god-like entity in the cloud.
It will be billions of **Personal Twins**, running on edge devices, evolving with their human counterparts.

*   When you learn, your Thomas learns (via **TK-APO**).
*   When you sleep, your Thomas dreams (via **GGA**).
*   When you forget, your Thomas remembers.

We are building the **infrastructure for the twin era**.
