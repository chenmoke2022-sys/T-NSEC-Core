## 💡 Professional Summary

**"Architecting Intelligence on the Edge with Intuition & Code."**

13 years of diverse experience (SEA E-commerce / Gov / Entrepreneurship). **Not a traditional coder**, but an **AI Orchestrator** who leverages LLMs to build enterprise-grade systems. Proven ability to architect and deliver complex solutions (T-NSEC) from scratch in **30 days** by combining product vision with AI execution.

Expert in **Edge AI**, **Neuro-Symbolic Architecture**, and **Cross-Cultural Strategy**. I bridge the gap between "Business Logic" and "Technical Implementation" using AI agents.

## 🚀 Core Project (The Manifesto)

### **T-NSEC-CORE: Edge-First Neuro-Symbolic Runtime**
*Role: Sole Architect & AI Orchestrator*
*Time: Oct 2025 - Present*

> *A proof-of-concept demonstrating how to run 7B models on consumer CPUs with 3x speedup, built entirely via AI-Native workflows.*

*   **Problem**: Cloud GPU costs are prohibitive for edge deployment; local small models lack reasoning capability.
*   **Solution**: Architected a **"Memory-Compute Decoupled"** system.
    *   **H-Spec (Hierarchical Speculation)**: Designed a scheduler using a 0.5B draft model to speed up 7B inference by **3x**.
    *   **SGE (Sparse Graph Encoding)**: Replaced standard RAG with **Weighted PPR** subgraph retrieval to eliminate hallucinations.
    *   **TK-APO (Temporal-Karma Optimization)**: Achieved **gradient-free Continual Learning** by evolving graph topology instead of model parameters.
*   **Outcome**: Delivered a Dockerized, rate-limited **Enterprise Server** and a comprehensive **Research Matrix** (5 technical whitepapers).

### 💡 Why Me?

I am the **"Missing Link"** between your engineering team and your business goals.
I don't just write code; I **envision systems**. I don't just follow specs; I **define architectures**.
In the AI era, the ability to **orchestrate intelligence** is more valuable than the ability to write syntax. I am ready to bring this new capability to your team.
